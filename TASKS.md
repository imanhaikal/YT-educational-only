\# TASKS.md



Below is a detailed, prioritized checklist of tasks for the \*\*YouTube Kid-Filter (MVP)\*\*. Each section is organized as actionable checkboxes you can assign, track, and mark complete. I thought through dependencies and acceptance criteria so this can be used directly by engineers, QA, and product.



---



\# 0. Legend \& conventions



\* ✅ = done; ⬜ = todo

\* `MUST` / `SHOULD` indicate priority.

\* Where helpful, I include short acceptance criteria (AC) under each major task.

\* Owner column is optional — fill it with team members or leave blank.



---



\# 1. Project setup (repo, CI, dependencies)



\* \[x] ✅ Create Git repositories: `extension/` and `backend/`. (owner: )

\* \[x] ✅ Add README.md with quick start for each repo.

\* \[x] ✅ Add `.gitignore`, `LICENSE`, and basic contributing guidelines.

\* \[x] ⬜ Configure CI (GitHub Actions or equivalent) to run:



&nbsp; \* \[x] linting for JS/TS

&nbsp; \* \[x] unit tests

&nbsp; \* \[x] build step for extension bundle

\* \[x] ⬜ Add issue/PR templates (bug, feature, chore).

\* \[x] ⬜ Create `env.example` for backend (no secrets).

\* AC: Repos exist, CI runs on PRs, and README contains local dev start instructions.



---



\# 2. Core extension scaffolding



\## 2.1 Manifest \& build



\* \[x] ⬜ Create `manifest.json` (Manifest V3) with minimal permissions:



&nbsp; \* `host\_permissions`: `https://www.youtube.com/\*`

&nbsp; \* `permissions`: `storage`, `scripting`, `alarms`

\* \[x] ⬜ Add build/bundle toolchain (esbuild/webpack/Vite) and npm scripts:



&nbsp; \* `build`, `dev`, `lint`, `test`

\* AC: `chrome://extensions` can load unpacked extension after build.



\## 2.2 Directory \& files



\* \[x] ⬜ `src/content-script/` — content script entry

\* \[x] ⬜ `src/service-worker/` — background/service worker

\* \[x] ⬜ `src/popup/` — popup HTML + JS

\* \[x] ⬜ `src/options/` — options UI

\* \[x] ⬜ `src/styles/` — shared CSS (scoped classes)

\* AC: Files present, build produces `dist/` ready to load.



---



\# 3. Content script: scraping, heuristics, DOM changes



\## 3.1 DOM detection \& extraction



\* \[x] ✅ Implement `MutationObserver` with debounce (200–400ms).

\* \[x] ✅ Implement robust selectors for cards (`ytd-rich-item-renderer`, `ytd-video-renderer`, etc).

\* \[x] ✅ Implement `extractVideoId(node)` util that handles `/watch?v=...` and shortened links.

\* \[x] ✅ Extract metadata: `title`, `descriptionSnippet`, `channelName`, `channelId` (if available), `durationSec`.

\* AC: On sample YouTube pages, `extractVideoId` returns correct IDs for >95% of visible cards.



## 3.2 Heuristics library (client-side)







* [x] ✅ Implement positive keyword list (education-related).



* [x] ✅ Implement negative keyword list (clickbait / entertainment).



* [x] ✅ Implement duration heuristics (short vs long).



* [x] ✅ Implement whitelist/blacklist check (reads from `chrome.storage.local`).



* [x] ✅ Implement decision structure: `decisive` vs `undecided`.



* AC: Heuristics produce `decision` with reason and confidence-like score; unit tests for keywords/duration.



\## 3.3 UI transformations



\* \[ ] ⬜ Implement placeholder component (HTML/CSS) for `hide` action.

\* \[ ] ⬜ Implement `blur` action using CSS classes (no global style collisions).

\* \[ ] ⬜ Implement `collapse` option (prefer animation + minimal layout shift).

\* \[ ] ⬜ Add reveal flow: `Reveal` button, optionally guarded by PIN flow via message to options page / service worker.

\* AC: Placeholder appears and reveal flow works on click.



---



\# 4. Background service worker (extension)



\* \[ ] ⬜ Implement message listener for `CLASSIFY\_VIDEO`.

\* \[ ] ⬜ Implement local cache logic using `chrome.storage.local` (TTL, max entries).

\* \[ ] ⬜ Implement queueing/batching logic (optional for MVP — single request OK; batching recommended).

\* \[ ] ⬜ Implement call to backend `POST /v1/classify` (with installationId).

\* \[ ] ⬜ Implement backoff \& retry policy, and offline flag (`lastBackendFailTs`).

\* \[ ] ⬜ Implement audit logging in storage (cap to 50 entries).

\* AC: Service worker responds to content script messages and returns cached/remote/heuristic responses as expected.



---



\# 5. Options \& Popup UIs



\## 5.1 Popup



\* \[ ] ⬜ Toggle on/off

\* \[ ] ⬜ Strictness controls (lenient/medium/strict)

\* \[ ] ⬜ Quick whitelist/blacklist buttons for active tab

\* \[ ] ⬜ Display count of hidden videos on current page (message from content script)

\* AC: Popup toggles settings and reflection of active page count works.



\## 5.2 Options page



\* \[ ] ⬜ Whitelist CRUD (add channel by ID/name, add video by URL)

\* \[ ] ⬜ Blacklist CRUD

\* \[ ] ⬜ Audit log view (last 50 entries, clear button)

\* \[ ] ⬜ PIN set/change flow (store salted hash; display warning about strength)

\* \[ ] ⬜ Telemetry opt-in toggle + Clear local data button

\* AC: Options persist to `chrome.storage.local` and reflect in content behavior.



---



\# 6. Backend proxy service



\## 6.1 Basic server \& endpoint



\* \[ ] ⬜ Create `server/` repo scaffold (Node/Express or serverless function).

\* \[ ] ⬜ Implement `POST /v1/classify` endpoint accepting JSON array or single object.

\* \[ ] ⬜ Validate `Origin` header against allowed extension ID(s).

\* AC: Server responds 200 to valid requests and 401/403 to invalid origins.



\## 6.2 Gemini integration



\* \[ ] ⬜ Implement prompt builder for `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` per Prompt Template.

\* \[ ] ⬜ Implement API call and parse response (strict JSON parsing).

\* \[ ] ⬜ Validate response fields (`label`, `confidence`, `reason`) and clamp confidence 0..1.

\* \[ ] ⬜ Truncate/limit input text to token/char limits before calling model.

\* AC: For a test payload, server returns structured JSON matching the contract.



\## 6.3 Security \& rate-limiting



\* \[ ] ⬜ Store GEMINI API key in environment (do not commit).

\* \[ ] ⬜ Add basic rate limiting (per IP and per installation token).

\* \[ ] ⬜ Add request logging (aggregate only; don't log raw titles by default).

\* \[ ] ⬜ Health endpoint and simple metrics endpoint (optional).

\* AC: Rate-limiting blocks excessive requests; key not present in repo.



---



\# 7. Model prompt \& contract QA



\* \[ ] ⬜ Prepare 10-20 test prompts with expected outputs to sanity check Gemini responses.

\* \[ ] ⬜ Implement server-side JSON validator and fallbacks (malformed → `uncertain`).

\* AC: Mocked model returns are parsed correctly and returned to extension.



---



\# 8. Caching, batching \& quotas



\* \[ ] ] Implement cache TTL (default 24h).

\* \[ ] ⬜ Implement cache eviction strategy (LRU or size cap).

\* \[ ] ⬜ Decide batching plan: single vs batched requests; implement chosen approach.

\* \[ ] ⬜ Implement storage of installationId (UUID generated at first install).

\* AC: Cache hits are used and backend calls reduce when cache present.



---



\# 9. Security \& privacy tasks



\* \[ ] ⬜ Ensure extension does not request extraneous permissions.

\* \[ ] ⬜ Document exactly what is sent to backend in privacy policy draft.

\* \[ ] ⬜ Implement PIN storage as salted hash and client-side verification.

\* \[ ] ⬜ Add option to clear all local data and instructions for data deletion.

## Short Description

A Chrome extension that helps parents filter out non-educational content on YouTube, creating a safer and more educational browsing experience for children.

## Long Description

YouTube Kid-Filter is a powerful Chrome extension designed to give parents more control over the content their children see on YouTube. The extension uses an advanced AI model to classify videos as either "educational" or "non-educational" in real-time.

**Key Features:**

*   **Content Filtering:** Automatically hides or de-emphasizes videos that are not educational, such as toy unboxings, challenges, and other content with little educational value.
*   **Customizable Settings:** Parents can adjust the filtering level to suit their child's needs and whitelist specific channels to ensure their favorite educational content is always accessible.
*   **PIN Protection:** The extension's settings can be protected with a PIN code to prevent children from changing them.
*   **Privacy-Focused:** The extension does not collect any personal information and all data is stored locally on your device.

**How it Works:**

The extension sends video metadata (title, channel name, etc.) to a secure backend server, which uses the Google Gemini AI model to classify the content. The extension then applies the appropriate UI changes on the YouTube page.

With YouTube Kid-Filter, you can create a safer and more enriching learning environment for your children on YouTube.

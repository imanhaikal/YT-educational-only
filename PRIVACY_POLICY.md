**Last Updated:** 2025-10-27

Thank you for using YouTube Kid-Filter (the "Extension"). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your data when you use our Extension.

## Data We Collect

We are committed to protecting your privacy. Our goal is to provide a safe and educational browsing experience for children on YouTube without collecting any personal information.

### Data Sent to Our Backend

When you use the Extension, it analyzes the content of YouTube videos to determine if they are educational. To do this, the Extension sends the following information to our backend server:

*   **Video Metadata:** The title, channel name, and other non-personal metadata of the videos you view on YouTube.

**We do not collect any personal or user-identifying information.** The data sent to our backend is limited to the text-based metadata of the videos and does not include any information about who is watching the video.

### Data We Store

The Extension stores the following information locally on your device:

*   **Extension Settings:** Your preferences and settings for the Extension, such as the filtering level and any whitelisted channels.
*   **PIN Code:** If you set a PIN code to protect the Extension's settings, it is stored locally on your device.

**We do not store any of your data on our servers.** All data is kept on your local machine.

## Opt-In Telemetry

To help us improve the Extension, we may ask you to opt-in to our anonymous telemetry program. If you choose to participate, the Extension will send us anonymous usage data, such as:

*   The number of videos filtered
*   The performance of the filtering algorithm

This data is completely anonymous and cannot be used to identify you or your child. It helps us understand how the Extension is being used and how we can make it better.
